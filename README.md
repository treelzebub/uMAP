# uMAP
<h3>::The Goal::

uMAP (untitled music aggregation project) is an Android frontend for the [Discogs.com](http://www.discogs.com) APIâ€”an attempt to make it even easier for people to browse their gigantic database of album releases; purchase music from independent record stores; keep track of record collections; and manage other user data.

I hope to have it ready for release by [Record Store Day](http://www.recordstoreday.com/), 2016.
