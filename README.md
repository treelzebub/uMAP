<h3>:: The Goal ::</h3>

uMAP (untitled music aggregation project) is an Android frontend for the [Discogs.com](http://www.discogs.com) API—an attempt to make it even easier for people to browse their gigantic database of album releases; purchase music from independent record stores; keep track of record collections; and manage other user data.
